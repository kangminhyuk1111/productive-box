> This project is inspired by an awesome pinned-gist project.<br/>Find more in https://github.com/matchai/awesome-pinned-gists
## Overview
This project uses GitHub graphQL API to get the commit histories and write into the gist by [rest.js](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js#readme)

## Setup

### Prep work
1. Create a new public GitHub Gist (https://gist.github.com/)
1. Create a token with the `gist` and `repo` scope and copy it. (https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
   > enable `repo` scope seems **DANGEROUS**<br/>
   > but this GitHub Action only accesses your commit timestamp in repository you contributed.
### Project setup

1. Fork this repo
1. Open the "Actions" tab of your fork and click the "enable" button
1. Edit the [environment variable](https://github.com/maxam2017/productive-box/blob/master/.github/workflows/schedule.yml#L17-L18) in `.github/workflows/schedule.yml`:

   - **GIST_ID:** The ID portion from your gist url: `https://gist.github.com/maxam2017/`**`9842e074b8ee46aef76fd0d493bae0ed`**.
   - **TIMEZONE:** The timezone of your location, eg. `Asia/Taipei` for Taiwan, `America/New_York` for America in New York, etc.

1. Go to the repo **Settings > Secrets**
1. Add the following environment variables:
   - **GH_TOKEN:** The GitHub token generated above.
1. [Pin the newly created Gist](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile)
